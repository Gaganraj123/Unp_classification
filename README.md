# Data Background 

• The data set was obtained from the Capital Bike Share program in Washington, D.C. which contained the
historical bike usage pattern with weather data spanning two years.

# Objective :

• Currently, Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities to enhance mobility comfort. It is important to
make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time.

• Hence, the objective here is to build a superior statistical model to predict the number of bicycles required
at each hour that can be rented with data availability.
